# Falling Blocks Game
 
This is my first creation of a 'complete' game in Unity. I'm following some fantastic tutorials presented by [Sebastian Lague on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmtyQOKKmrMVaKuRXz02jbQ). I hope you enjoy my first game!

### Objective
Dodge the fallling blocks for as long as possible

### Controls

 - **W, A** (or d-pad) to move.
 - **Spacebar** to reset after gameover
